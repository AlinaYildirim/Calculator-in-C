# Calculator Project in C

## Description

This project is a comprehensive calculator program developed by Alina Yildirim. It's designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to more complex functions like trigonometry, exponentiation, and logarithms. The calculator features a graphical user interface built using the graphics.h library, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Advanced mathematical functions: Square Root, Power, Exponential, Logarithmic functions, and Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses).
- User-friendly graphical interface with a selection menu for operations.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- Turbo C++ or a similar compiler that supports `graphics.h`.
- DOSBox or a similar DOS emulator (if running on a modern operating system).

### Steps to Compile and Run

1. Ensure that the `graphics.h` library and its associated driver files (`BGI`) are correctly set up in your Turbo C++ environment.
2. Copy the code into a new file in the Turbo C++ editor and save it with a `.c` extension.
3. Compile the program by pressing `Alt + F9`.
4. Run the compiled program by pressing `Ctrl + F9`.

## Usage

Upon running the program, the graphical interface will display a list of available mathematical operations. Use the keyboard to input the number corresponding to the desired operation and follow the on-screen instructions to enter the required values. The result will be displayed on the screen.
